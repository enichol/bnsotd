So here’s my theory on why old Hank is so revered. First of all, he has this mournful, nasally cadence that somehow plants itself directly into your inner typanium and never lets go. But more importantly, Hank never sang about anything other than what he had personally experienced. Sometimes he is as giddy as a school boy, other times depressed to the point of suicide. But always, always he is genuine. And far too few country stars today can say that. Quite a short life of trouble indeed, but boy oh boy, we sure gained a lot from his misery.
