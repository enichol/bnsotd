Here is a gorgeous track to get us back on the bandwagon. (Wow you Big Nicks are kind of unruly when you don’t get your daily fix!) This one should settle you down nicely. Those “buh jahp shuh wops” always make the hair stand up on the back of my neck. As it turns out, this song was originally released in 1957. That’s the same year my brother was born, which makes them both very, very, very old. But everyone will be glad to know old age has made us both happier than we were in our youth (see picture attached).

Happy Birthday Hugh – you are the genuine original Big Nick. ;0)
