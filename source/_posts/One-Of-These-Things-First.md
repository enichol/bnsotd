Oh my my. This one’s a real treat and always puts me in the zone. I’m a sucker for a good waltz, especially when the song is about existential re-incarnation. Poor Nick Drake was a manic depressive, painfully shy and could only communicate through music. He ended up committing suicide at age 27. And as to the car commercial that introduced us, I never did buy that Volkswagen.

Have a great weekend everyone!
