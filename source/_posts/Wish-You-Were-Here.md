OMG. The violin on this track is absolutely gorgeous! If you would like some more, there’s half a century of recordings of Grappelli with the likes of Django Reinhardt and Yehudi Menuhin. Highly, highly recommended.

Oh and for you Floyd fans, feel free to smoke a doobie while listening. It’s practically obligatory and now almost legal in Canada.
