Hereâ€™s a lovely one just before the holidays. Aging is a fickle thing. You know I spent the majority of my life thinking Led Zeppelin were just a bunch of puffters. Today, I consider them my favourite band of all time, and this indeed is my favourite song amongst my 37,000 collection. I am told that Joan van der Meer was quite a Robert Plant groupie in the day (and still is), but I caution that those rumours are unsubstantiated. Merry Christmas everyone and ZEPPELIN RULES!
