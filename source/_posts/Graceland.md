Here’s a great one to start off the weekend. “There’s a girl in New York City who calls herself a human trampoline.” That line of course refers to Simon’s soon to be ex-wife Carrie Fisher, who was suffering from manic depression at the time. “She comes back to tell me she’s gone. As if I didn’t know that. As if I didn’t know my own bed.” Wow this guy is good.

BTW, if you ever wondered what a National Guitar looks like, it’s kinda like the Mississippi Delta.
