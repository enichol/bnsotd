What a great way to start off the week. Stunning performance. She somehow crawls right inside the song and makes it her own. Always gives me shivers up and down my spine. Also, this will be the 50th anniversary of the songâ€™s composition during the Dylan/Band Basement Tapes. Way before Bieber, the great Richard Manuel had already put Stratford on the rock n roll map. Enjoy.
