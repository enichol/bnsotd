Sir Duke wrote this in tribute to one of the dancers at the Cotton Club in Harlem, the place where his orchestra was the house band in the late 20’s. Given the title, its easy to gather what part of her anatomy he was admiring. This one goes out to Lisa Harper. If this doesn’t make you want to get jiggy old gal, nothing will.
