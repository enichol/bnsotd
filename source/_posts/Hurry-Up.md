Upon the disintegration of Buffalo Springfield In 1968, the band members went their own separate ways. Stills went to Crosby, Stills and Nash; drummer Dewey Martin joined the Dillards and Neil Young became… well Neil. Guitarist/composer Richie Furay formed Poco, one of the very first country-rock outfits after the Byrds and Flying Burrito Brothers. He wanted to name them Pogo after his favorite comic strip, but alas, the Pogo corporation threaten a lawsuit. Hence the “G” was switched to a “C” and the rest is history.
