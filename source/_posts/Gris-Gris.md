So I’ve always wanted to get me some of that gris-gris stuff, but I haven’t been able to find any of the ingredients at my local Foodland. Let me know if any of you out there have some:

“control in the hearts get together drops”
“utilize rub put some on my drop fix and jam, put some in your breakfast”
“dragon blood”
“drawen hidin'”
“secret sand”
“black cat put it in the palm of your hand”
 
Thanks.
