You know, despite having some problems with spelling and vowel recognition, the Byrds were a truly extraordinary band. In the space of 6 short years, they singlehandedly invented not one, not two, but three distinct and original musical genres, including folk rock, psychedelic rock and country rock. This offering comes from the third phase launched in 1968, a fine piece of work in my opinion.
