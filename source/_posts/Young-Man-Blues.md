This is what we in Huron County call a "two-fer-one deal". I also call it a study in contrast. BTW - Mose Allison has a compilation best of called Ã€llison Wonderland. And what is more, for those of you that don't know him, Mose Allison bears an uncanny resemblance to BNSOTD alumnus David J. Stinson!
