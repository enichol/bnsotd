In the words of the great Jim Niesen, this one should gob-smack you! Pay attention to the pitch perfect falsetto at the end. Say what you want – Michael Buble can’t come close to this, never mind most of the contestants on American Idol. For the record, Morrissey is crooning for a departed gay lover, which just goes to show that Big Nick is also LGBT friendly.
