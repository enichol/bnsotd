Seth jokes that whenever he hears this song, he wants to jump right back in my arms again. Aside from that being a bit socially awkward, I don’t think I could physically do it anymore. But all father/son camaraderie aside, this might be the prettiest song you have never heard.
 
Ethan, if you are reading this, don’t feel bad. I was pretty heavy into Captain Beefheart when you were in my arms, and the BNSOTD audience just ain’t ready for that quite yet.
 
Have a great weekend everyone.
