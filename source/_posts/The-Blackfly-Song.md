Here’s a warm welcome to the newest members of Big Nick’s Gang of Thieves – Glen Loo and Lisette Gelinas. Lisette, this one is dedicated especially to you and  your vast experience in promoting tourism across Northern Ontario. I could be wrong, but I think this song and the subsequent National Film Board vignette (below) set the Northern Ontario tourism industry back by decades. Apparently the Department of Northern Mines and Development even tried to have it banned. J I know one thing for sure – I won’t be going to visit the Little Abitibi anytime soon!
 
Have a great weekend everyone!
