So here's cheerful little piece that I want to dedicate to my good friend
Rob Nicholson. Rob and I went to high school together in the late 1920's
and soon gravitated to each other due to our common love of music. When
this song first hit the airwaves, I wasn't sure what to make of it. It
didn't sound anything like the Bee Gees. Rob said to me at the time
"Whenever I hear that new Bruce Cockburn song about him dreaming of lions,
I think of the Old Man and the Sea" - who also dreamt of lions. I was
immediately committed to both Bruce and Rob. Please enjoy.
