I reckon the vast majority of listeners will know Los Lobos from one thing only: La Bamba. But there is more. So much more. In fact, I believe Los Lobos is to the Mexican American community what the Tragically Hip are to Canadians. Please enjoy this genuine, sincere prayer to bring some “peace to the neighbourhood”.
