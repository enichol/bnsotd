Good morning folks. I missed a day or so due to an unfortunate happen-stance with my arch enemy – gravity. But no worries folks, I’m back in the saddle again.

Here’s a lovely nibble of pop confection by Toronto’s very own Cowboy Junkies. Come to think of it, Canadian artists are exceptionally well represented on my favourites play-list. Perhaps this is a testament to the success of CRTC’s Canadian content rules?
