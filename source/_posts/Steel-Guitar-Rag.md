If any of you have seen “O Brother Where Art Thou”, you will recall a character Governor Pappy O’Daniel who at the end of the movie pardons the runaway jailbirds in order to gain votes. In fact, there really was a Governor Pappy O’Daniel. He was governor of Texas in the 1930’s. He made his fortune producing and selling “Light Crust Flour”. In order to promote his product, he formed a western swing band called “The Light Crust Dough Boys”. They toured the southwest encouraging everyone to only use Light Crust Flour. The bandleader, Bob Wills, got a little tired of things, so he quit and moved on to form his own band, the Texas Playboys. Now this is where it gets interesting. As Governor of Texas, Pappy O’Daniel had Bob Wills banned from ever setting foot in Texas again.
