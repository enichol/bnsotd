So Sgt. Pepper took you by surprise
You better see right through that mother's eyes
Those freaks was right when they said you was dead
The one mistake you made was in your head
Ah, how do you sleep
Ah, how do you sleep at night
You live with straights who tell you, you was king
Jump when your momma tell you anything
The only thing you done was yesterday

![John & Paul](Lennon-McCartney.jpg)

And since you're gone you're just another day
Ah, how do you sleep
Ah, how do you sleep at night
Ah, how do you sleep
Ah, how do you sleep at night
A pretty face may last a year or two
But pretty soon they'll see what you can do
The sound you make is muzak to my ears
You must have learned something in all those years
Ah, how do you sleep
Ah, how do you sleep at night
