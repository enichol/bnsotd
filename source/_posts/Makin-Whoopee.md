Now that we are well out of the Valentine’s haze, let’s come back down to earth. Here’s a lovely little ditty about two of my favourite topics – infidelity and divorce. You know, Kathy and I had this as a lead-off song for our wedding reception. Somehow, nobody got the joke except us.
 
On another note, apparently the 1973-74 Macon Whoopees were one of the worst teams in the history of professional hockey. They folded after one year due to average attendance figures of 38 people per game.
 
Finally, a special welcome to a newly unsolicited member of the Big Nick’s community, Andrew Kemp. You weren’t expecting this I bet! Perhaps you and Kim can start your own Victims of Big Nick’s Support Group.
