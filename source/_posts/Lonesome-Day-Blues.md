Here’s Bob spitting and growling his way through a modern day classic. No matter what you say, I don’t think anyone alive today can make music this visceral. My favourite part is when he snarls: “He’s not a gentleman at all. He’s rotten to the core. He’s a coward. And he steals!” This always pops into my head whenever Niesen pisses me off, which is often.

Sit back and listen as Bob teaches peace to the conquered and tames the proud. And crank ‘er up loud if you can stand it.
