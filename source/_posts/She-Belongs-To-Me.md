Here’s a pretty love song in honour of Valentine’s Day. Of course, Bob is pretty wry about the whole affair. He knows darn well that She Doesn’t Belong to Him. In fact, that’s the whole point. She doesn’t belong to anyone. Maybe though if it’s really true love, they both belong to each other. J
 
Speaking of true love …… how could anyone not fall in love with that smiling face. It’s been over 30 years of happiness, and hopefully another 30 years to go. For those of you that don’t know, not only is it Valentine’s Day, but it’s also Kathy’s birthday.
 
So I ask that everyone do as Bob says….
 
“Bow down to her on Sunday and salute her when her birthday comes.”

Love You.
