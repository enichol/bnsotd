Here’s a nice little ditty from another Canadian songbird. You’d think after centuries of song writing, it would be hard for artists to come up with new hummable melodies, but somehow Sarah pulls it off. I also like the nautical metaphor in the chorus. God Bless Sarah Harmer! God Bless Canadian Content rules! God Bless the CRTC!
