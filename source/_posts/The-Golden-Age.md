Well, that’s enough levity for now. Time to delve deeply into a dark hole of Big Nick’s self-pity. We spoke earlier of Gene Clark’s approach to break-up songs, ranging from relief to outright jubilation. Not so with our friend Beck. He’s miserable. “These days I barely get by. I don’t even try”. Of course, I seem to have received the brunt of collateral damage on this one. It makes me wonder if my parents were as heartbroken as I am right now when their son broke up with a girlfriend. Then again, I tended to switch girlfriends like changing shirts, so I expect they kind of got used to it.
