Many of you probably don’t realize that Hank Sr. has a grandson Hank III – you guessed it – son of Hank Jr. The resemblance is uncanny. Anyway, the Nashville recording executives had a great brain-wave. Let’s package Hank III up and promote him to all those millions of admirers that still revere his older namesake. Well, Hank III went along for a while, but then reneged on his contracts. Turns out he can’t stand country music. He now tours the country with his very own punk/gloom metal band. I can’t make this stuff up. Now I just wonder. Is old Hank rolling in his grave or pleased with the spunk, gumption and rebelliousness of his grandson? I expect it’s the latter.
