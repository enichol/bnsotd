And now folks, for something completely different. Today's song of the day
is not actually a song - it's a film. My son Seth fancies himself a bit of a
Quentin Tarantino with a penchant for spaghetti westerns. Please find
attached a submission he has prepared for his application to Film & Video at
Sheridan College in Oakville. As Eric Burdon commented on a previous BNSOTD:
"Who would have thought that me, a noble-fared, long-haired leaping gnome
could be the star of a Hollywood movie?"  I don't think I'll quit my day
job.
