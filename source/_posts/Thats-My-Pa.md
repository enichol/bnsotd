This reminds me of the time the horses brought me home from the old Queen’s Hotel after I’d had more than the doctor prescribed. I actually tried that trick where you dive off the wagon seat and go swimming in the dirt. It hurt like hell and I won’t do that again. Truthfully Yours. Wooo hooo! Wooo oooo whooo! Hah! Hah! Hah! Hah! Hah!
