Believe it or not, this song was already on my set list. The tune has been bouncing around in my head constantly for the better part of 50 years. It just happens to be quite appropriate for today. MTM was such a sweetheart. And those black slacks made her look hotter than a two dollar pistol!

On another note, I bet you didnâ€™t know there were lyrics to the theme music. They were written by co-stars Dick Van Dyke and Morey Amsterdam.

Go ahead. Sing along.

THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW THEME SONG
(Music by Earle Hagen / Lyrics by Morey Amsterdam)
Dick Van Dyke


So you think that you've got troubles?
Well, trouble's a bubble,
So tell old Mr. Trouble to "Get lost!".

Why not hold your head up high and,
Stop cryin', start tryin',
And don't forget to keep your fingers crossed.

When you find the joy of livin'
Is lovin' and givin'
You'll be there when the winning dice are tossed.

A smile is just a frown that's turned upside down,
So smile, and that frown will defrost.
And don't forget to keep your fingers crossed!
