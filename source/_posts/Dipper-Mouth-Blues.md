Hey there all you jazz cats. Seems like a good day for a Satchmo selection. If you dig this, I recommend seeking out West End Blues or even Hello Dolly, which unbelievably blew the Beatles off the charts 40 years after this recording. And who do you think was Armstrongâ€™s favourite jazz band of the era? Guy Lombardo & His Royal Canadians. Go figure.
