According to historians, Constantinople was where the action was in the Year 1017. It was the largest metropolitan centre on earth (population 800,000), and controlled something like 90% of all worldwide trade at the time. It was definitely the place to ride your camel, kinda  like the New York City of its era.
 
Dig it!
