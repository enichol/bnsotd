So my dear wife walks in while we are recording this edition of BNSOTD. She hears me refer to someone by the name of “Shannon”. Her face turns red, she points a finger at me, and yells – “You’re playing songs for old girlfriends aren’t you!  Do you think I’m invisible and wouldn’t notice? Well I’m not going to put up with it!” And she stomps out of the room. Yes, I did long ago have a girlfriend by the name of Shannon, but my choice of song was completely innocent, I swear.  Nevertheless, I had to sleep on the couch that night. True Story.
