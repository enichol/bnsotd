Well you knew there had to be some Beatles in here somewhere along the way. Like most Beatles songs, itâ€™s almost impossible to keep you from being in a good mood. BTW, all those rumours suggesting this song is about cocaine are entirely false. McCartney literally wrote the song while watching a drip come through the ceiling on a rainy day.
